# 🦜 Generative Deep Learning

## [NEW] 🚀 2nd edition codebase now live!

⚠️ This repository is no longer maintained as the codebase for the 2nd edition of Generative Deep Learning is now live!

Please head over to https://github.com/davidADSP/Generative_Deep_Learning_2nd_Edition to check it out.

## Branches

The `master` branch of this repo contains the Tensorflow 1.14 code that is present in the original book (first edition)

The  `tensorflow_2` branch contains updated code that runs using Tensorflow 2.

However, I recommend swiching over to the repository for the 2nd edition (see above), as it contains many new examples and improvements to the overall structure.
